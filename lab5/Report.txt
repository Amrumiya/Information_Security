n this lab, we explored fundamental Linux user management tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting users. We used the adduser command to create a new user, assigned it to a specific group using usermod -aG, and verified the changes with cat /etc/passwd and groups commands. We also tested switching users with su - username and ensuring the new user had appropriate permissions. Finally, we removed the user using deluser --remove-home and confirmed its deletion from the system.

This exercise helped us understand how Linux handles user accounts and groups, ensuring controlled access to system resources. By managing groups, we learned how to assign multiple users to shared permissions, which is essential for system security. Additionally, using commands like whoami and pkill -KILL -u username, we saw how to monitor and manage logged-in users effectively.
